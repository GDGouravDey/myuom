# MyUoM Deployment Documentation

## Deployment Options

There are 2 main methods for deploying the MyUoM application to a web server:

1. **Manually via FTP**
2. **Automated with GitHub Actions**

---

## 1. Manual Deployment via FTP (Deprecated - Not used anymore)

To manually deploy MyUoM via cPanel, follow these steps:

1. **Log in to cPanel**:

    - Access cPanel with your account credentials.

2. **Select File Manager**:

    - In cPanel, locate the Files section and select "File Manager." \

3. **Choose the Folder**:

    - Navigate to the server folder where files should be uploaded. Typically, files should go into the `public_html` folder (as done in our production). \

4. **Update the `.htaccess` File**:

    - Open the `.htaccess` file and replace its contents with the following code to handle URL redirection and PHP settings:

        ```apache
        <IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
          RewriteEngine On

          # Don't rewrite requests to index.html
          RewriteRule ^index\.html$ - [L]

          # Rewrite all other non-existent file or directory requests to index.html
          RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
          RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
          RewriteRule . /index.html [L]
        </IfModule>

        # php -- BEGIN cPanel-generated handler, do not edit
        # Set the “ea-php81” package as the default “PHP” programming language.
        <IfModule mime_module>
          AddHandler application/x-httpd-ea-php81 .php .php8 .phtml
        </IfModule>
        # php -- END cPanel-generated handler, do not edit
        ```

5. **Prepare Build Files**:

    - Navigate to the MyUoM application folder on your computer.

    - Run `npm run build` to create the application's build.

    - A `build` folder will be created containing the static version of the application with files to be uploaded to the server.

6. **Upload Files**:

    - Go back to the File Manager in cPanel, navigate to the desired folder (`public_html`), and select the Upload button. \

    - On the next page, you can drag and drop the application files. \

7. **Upload Files**:

    - Upload all contents of the `build` folder from your computer to the server (using the file manager from the previous step).

8. **Reconfigure `.htaccess` Settings**:

    - After uploading, ensure the `.htaccess` file is present. If not, repeat step 4.

9. **Complete Deployment**:
    - Wait a few moments for the changes to take effect.
    - Verify the deployment was successful by visiting your website.

## 2. Automated Upload with GitHub Actions (Currently in Use)

To automate the above process, we use GitHub Actions. Here’s what needs to be done:

1. **`.github/workflows/deploy-prod.yml` File**:

    - The `deploy-prod.yml` file defines a job that runs on every push to the `main` branch of the repository. This job handles building the application and uploading it to the [production server](https://my.uom.gr) via FTP.

2. **Key Steps of the Workflow**:

    - **Checkout Code**: The process starts by retrieving the latest code from the repository using `actions/checkout@v3`.
    - **Set Up Node.js**: The required Node.js version is installed for building the application using `actions/setup-node@v3`.
    - **Install Dependencies**: Project dependencies are installed with the command `npm install --legacy-peer-deps`.
    - **Build**: The application is built with the command `CI=false npm run build`.
    - **Upload to FTP Server**: The contents of the `build` folder are uploaded via FTP using [SamKirkland/FTP-Deploy-Action@v4.3.5](https://www.github.com/SamKirkland/FTP-Deploy-Action).

3. **Using the Workflow**:

    - **Code Updates**: Each time changes are pushed to the `main` branch, the workflow automatically handles building and uploading the application (the process uses hashing and checks if changes affect files to be uploaded. If a current build is identical to the content on the server, files are not uploaded).
    - **Monitoring**: You can monitor the deployment progress and any errors via the [Actions](https://github.com/open-source-uom/myuom/actions) tab.

4. **Example `deploy.yml`**

```yaml
name: Deploy to Production with FTP

on:
    push:
        branches:
            - main

jobs:
    build:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest

        steps:
            - name: Checkout code
              uses: actions/checkout@v3

            - name: Set up Node.js
              uses: actions/setup-node@v3
              with:
                  node-version: '20' # Use the Node.js version you need

            - name: Install dependencies
              run: |
                  npm install --legacy-peer-deps  # Added option to handle peer dependency issues

            - name: Build
              run: |
                  CI=false npm run build

            - name: Upload to FTP server
              uses: SamKirkland/FTP-Deploy-Action@v4.3.5
              with:
                  local-dir: build/
                  server: ${{ secrets.FTP_SERVER }}
                  username: ${{ secrets.FTP_USERNAME_PROD }}

                  port: ${{ secrets.FTP_PORT }}
